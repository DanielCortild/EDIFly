Briefing Re-Launch EDIfly Web-Site July 2020

**General:**

**The new web site for EDIfly will be a rather simplistic &#39;landing page&#39;, with just a few head-line messages, graphics (no animations) and the ability for the client to download the current product briefing (flyer), sample topologies, white papers on different subjects, and the latest FAQ.**

**It must appeal to aviation businesses&#39; management staff, who don&#39;t really understand the underlying technology but are aiming to achieve cost savings and simplify processes, while catering to the tech-savvy staff, who want to &#39;dig in&#39; deeper in order to understand the capabilities of EDIfly as a by-pass solution to legacy circuits and corporate message broker.**

**To obtain**  **any**  **download the user must leave his e-mail address, which will trigger an automatic copy to** [**sales@edifly.com**](mailto:sales@edifly.com) **.**

**Also, a simple list of reference users (not clients) will be added.**

**The EDIfly team will be able to upload PDFs with the product briefing(s), white papers, users/clients (with logo and web-site), and FAQ without having to change the coding of the web-site.**
